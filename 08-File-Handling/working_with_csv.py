# ----------------------------------------------------
# 1. WHAT IS A CSV FILE?
# ----------------------------------------------------
# - A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file stores tabular data in plain text format.
# - Each row is on a new line, and each value is separated by a delimiter (commonly a comma ',').
# - Example content:
#     Name, Age, Country
#     Alice, 25, USA
#     Bob, 30, UK
# - CSV files are widely used for data exchange between applications (Excel, databases, etc.)

# ----------------------------------------------------
# 2. WRITING TO A CSV FILE
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Let's create a CSV file and write some data to it.
people_data = [
    ["Name", "Age", "Country"],
    ["Alice", 25, "USA"],
    ["Bob", 30, "UK"],
    ["Charlie", 28, "Canada"]
]

with open("people.csv", mode="w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(people_data)  # Write multiple rows at once

print("âœ… 'people.csv' created and written successfully.")

# ----------------------------------------------------
# 3. READING A CSV FILE
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Reading data back from the file
with open("people.csv", mode="r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    print("\nðŸ“‚ Reading CSV file content:")
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # Each row is a list of strings

# ----------------------------------------------------
# 4. APPENDING DATA TO A CSV FILE
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Adding a new record without overwriting the file
with open("people.csv", mode="a", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["David", 35, "Australia"])

print("\nâœ… Data appended to 'people.csv'.")

# ----------------------------------------------------
# 5. READING CSV FILE INTO DICTIONARIES
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Sometimes, you want data with keys (column names).
with open("people.csv", mode="r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    print("\nðŸ“‚ Reading CSV as dictionaries:")
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # Each row is an OrderedDict with column names as keys

# ----------------------------------------------------
# 6. WRITING DICTIONARIES TO CSV
# ----------------------------------------------------
people_dict_data = [
    {"Name": "Emma", "Age": 22, "Country": "Germany"},
    {"Name": "Liam", "Age": 29, "Country": "France"}
]

with open("people_dict.csv", mode="w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    fieldnames = ["Name", "Age", "Country"]
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()  # Write column names
    writer.writerows(people_dict_data)  # Write data rows

print("\nâœ… 'people_dict.csv' created successfully.")

# ----------------------------------------------------
# 7. COMMON PITFALLS AND TIPS
# ----------------------------------------------------
# - Always open CSV files with newline="" to avoid blank lines in Windows.
# - Specify encoding (e.g., utf-8) to handle special characters.
# - Use DictReader and DictWriter for easier handling with named columns.
# - If your CSV uses a different delimiter (e.g., semicolon ';'), pass it like:
#     csv.reader(file, delimiter=';')
# - For very large CSV files, consider using the `pandas` library for faster processing.
